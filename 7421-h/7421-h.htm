<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>GREATER
BRITAIN</h3>
<p class="poetry">Our hearts were not set on fighting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not pant for the fray,<br />
And whatever wrongs need righting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We would not have met that way.<br />
But the way that has opened before us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leads on thro&rsquo; a blood-red field;<br />
And we swear by the great God o&rsquo;er us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We will die, but we will not yield.</p>
<p class="poetry">The battle is not of our making,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And war was never our plan;<br />
Yet, all that is sweet forsaking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We march to it, man by man.<br />
It is either to smite, or be smitten,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no other choice to-day;<br />
And we live, as befits the Briton,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or we die, as the Briton may.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>We were not fashioned for cages,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or to feed from a keeper&rsquo;s hand;<br />
Our strength which has grown thro&rsquo; ages<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the strength of a slave-free land.<br />
We cannot kneel down to a master,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To our God alone can we pray;<br />
And we stand in this world disaster,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fight, like a lion at bay.</p>
<h3><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>BELGIUM</h3>
<p class="poetry">Ruined? destroyed?&nbsp; Ah, no; though blood
in rivers ran<br />
Down all her ancient streets; though treasures manifold<br />
Love-wrought, Time-mellowed, and beyond the price of gold<br />
Are lost, yet Belgium&rsquo;s star shines still in God&rsquo;s
vast plan.</p>
<p class="poetry">Rarely have Kings been great, since kingdoms
first began;<br />
Rarely have great kings been great men, when all was told.<br />
But, by the lighted torch in mail&egrave;d hands, behold,<br />
Immortal Belgium&rsquo;s immortal king, and Man.</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>KNITTING</h3>
<p class="poetry">At the concert and the play<br />
Everywhere you see them sitting,<br />
Knitting, knitting.<br />
Women who the other day<br />
Thought of nothing but their frocks<br />
Or their jewels or their locks,<br />
Women who have lived for pleasure,<br />
Who have known no work but leisure,<br />
Now are knitting, knitting, knitting<br />
For the soldiers over there.</p>
<p class="poetry">On the trains and on the ships<br />
With a diligence befitting,<br />
They are knitting.<br />
Some with smiles upon their lips,<br />
Some with manners debonair,<br />
Some with earnest look and air.<br />
But each heart in its own fashion,<br />
Weaves in pity and compassion<br />
In their knitting, knitting, knitting<br />
For the soldiers over there.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Hurried women to and fro<br />
From their homes to labour flitting,<br />
Knitting, knitting,<br />
Busy handed come and go.<br />
Broken bits of time they spare,<br />
Just to feel they do their share,<br />
Just to keep life&rsquo;s sense of beauty<br />
In the doing of a duty,<br />
They are knitting, knitting, knitting<br />
For the soldiers over there.</p>
<h3><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>MOBILISATION</h3>
<p class="poetry">Oh the Kings of earth have mobilised their
men.<br />
See them moving, valour proving,<br />
To the fields of glory going,<br />
Banners flowing, bugles blowing,<br />
Every one a mother&rsquo;s son,<br />
Brave with uniform and gun,<br />
Keeping step with easy swing,<br />
Yes, with easy step and light marching onward to the fight,<br />
Just to please the warlike fancy of a King;<br />
Who has mobilised his army for the strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh the King of Death has mobilised his men.<br
/>
See the hearses huge and black<br />
How they rumble down the track;<br />
With their coffins filled with dead,<br />
Filled with men who fought and bled;<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Now from
fields of glory coming<br />
To the sound of muffled drumming<br />
They are lying still and white,<br />
But the Kings have had their fight;<br />
Death has mobilised his army for the grave.</p>
<h3><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>NEUTRAL</h3>
<p class="poetry">That pale word &lsquo;Neutral&rsquo; sits
becomingly<br />
On lips of weaklings.&nbsp; But the men whose brains<br />
Find fuel in their blood, the men whose minds<br />
Hold sympathetic converse with their hearts,<br />
Such men are never neutral.&nbsp; That word stands<br />
Unsexed and impotent in Realms of Speech.<br />
When mighty problems face a startled world<br />
No virile man is neutral.&nbsp; Right or wrong<br />
His thoughts go forth, assertive, unafraid<br />
To stand by his convictions, and to do<br />
Their part in shaping issues to an end.<br />
Silence may guard the door of useless words,<br />
At dictate of Discretion; but to stand<br />
Without opinions in a world which needs<br />
Constructive thinking, is a coward&rsquo;s part.</p>
<h3><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>A BOOK
FOR THE KING</h3>
<p class="poetry">A book has been made for the King,<br />
A book of beauty and art;<br />
To the good king&rsquo;s eyes<br />
A smile shall rise<br />
Hiding the ache in his heart&mdash;<br />
Hiding the hurt and the grief<br />
As he turns it, leaf by leaf.</p>
<p class="poetry">A book has been made for the King,<br />
A book of blood and of blight;<br />
To the Great King&rsquo;s eyes<br />
A look shall rise<br />
That will blast and wither and smite&mdash;<br />
Yes, smite with a just God&rsquo;s rage,<br />
As He turns it, page by page.</p>

Their faith, methinks, is greater by far<br />

<p class="poetry">Said the god of the Czar: &lsquo;My people

I will lend my strength to them one and all.<br />
Wherever they fight their foes shall fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like grass where the mowers go.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then the god of the Gauls spoke out of a

&nbsp;&nbsp; To the god of the King nearby:<br />
&lsquo;Our people pray, tho&rsquo; they pray not loud;<br />

<p class="poetry">There was no wind, and yet the air<br />

There were no forms, and yet all space<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed thronged with growing hosts.<br />
They came from Where, and from Nowhere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like phantoms as they were;<br />
They came from many a land and place&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts.</p>
<p class="poetry">And some were white, and some were grey,<br />

Those ghosts of men who met their death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the field of war.<br />
Against the skies of fading day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like banks of cloud they stood;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;What were we fighting for?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Another, &lsquo;At the bugle&rsquo;s call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I left my bride behind;<br />
Love made so beautiful my life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not bear to die.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">In voices like the winds that moan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among pine trees at night,<br />
They whispered long, the newly dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While listening stars came out.<br />
&lsquo;We wonder if the cause is known,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And if the war was right,<br />
That killed us in our prime,&rsquo; they said,<br />

<p class="poetry">They came in throngs that filled all

&nbsp;&nbsp; Those whispering phantom hosts;<br />

POET&rsquo;S THEME</h3>
<p class="poetry">Why should the poet of these pregnant times<br
/>
Be asked to sing of war&rsquo;s unholy crimes?</p>
<p class="poetry">To laud and eulogise the trade which thrives<br
/>
On horrid holocausts of human lives?</p>
<p class="poetry">Man was a fighting beast when earth was
young,<br />
And war the only theme when Homer sung.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twixt might and might the equal contest
lay:<br />
Not so the battles of our modern day.</p>
<p class="poetry">Too often now the conquering hero struts,<br />
A Gulliver among the Lilliputs.</p>
<p class="poetry">Success no longer rests on skill or fate,<br />
But on the movements of a syndicate.</p>
<p class="poetry">Of old, men fought and deemed it right and
just,<br />
To-day the warrior fights because he must;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>And in his secret soul feels shame because<br />
He desecrates the higher manhood&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, there are worthier themes for poet&rsquo;s
pen<br />
In this great hour than bloody deeds of men:</p>
<p class="poetry">The rights of many&mdash;not the worth of
one&mdash;<br />
The coming issues, not the battle done;</p>
<p class="poetry">The awful opulence and awful need&mdash;<br />
The rise of brotherhood&mdash;the fall of greed;</p>
<p class="poetry">The soul of man replete with God&rsquo;s own
force,<br />
The call &lsquo;to heights,&rsquo; and not the cry &lsquo;to
horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Are there not better themes in this great
age<br />
For pen of poet, or for voice of sage,</p>
<p class="poetry">Than those old tales of killing?&nbsp; Song is
dumb<br />
Only that greater song in time may come.</p>
<p class="poetry">When comes the bard, he whom the world waits
for,<br />
He will not sing of War.</p>

Peace should not come, until we cleanse the path.<br />
God waited for us; now in awful wrath<br />
He pours the blood of men out day by day<br />

Why, what would Peace do, in a world where hearts<br />
Are filled with thoughts like poison-pointed darts?<br />
It were not meet, surely it were not meet<br />
For Peace to come, and with her white robes hide<br />
These industries of death&mdash;these guns and swords,&mdash;<br
/>
These uniformed, hate-filled, destructive hordes,&mdash;<br />
These hideous things, that are each nation&rsquo;s pride.<br />
So long as men believe in arm&egrave;d might<br />
Let arms be brandished.&nbsp; Let not Peace be sought<br />
Until the race-heart empties out all thought<br />
Of blows and blood, as arguments for Right.<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>The world
has never had enough of war,<br />
Else war were not.&nbsp; Now let the monster stand,<br />
Until he slays himself with his own hand;<br />

Then in the place where wicked cannons stood<br />
Let Peace erect her shrine of Brotherhood.</p>

Or, seeing, sensed it beauty, I was stirred<br />
To awe and wonder by those orbs of light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All palpitant against empurpled skies.<br />
They spoke a language to my childish heart<br />
Of mystery and splendour, and of space,<br />
Friendly with gracious, unseen presences.<br />
Beauty was first revealed to me by stars.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a window looking to the west;<br />
Beyond it, wide Wisconsin fields of grain,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Would gather in the afternoon to rest.<br />
And when the sun went down behind that hill<br />
What scenes of glory spread before my sight;<br />
What beauty&mdash;beauty, absolute, supreme!<br />
Sunsets enlarged the meaning of that word.</p>
<p class="poetry">Clover in blossom, red and honey-sweet,<br />

Across the meadow lands.&nbsp; One day, I stood<br />
Breast-high amidst its waves, and heard the hum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of myriad bees, that had gone mad like me<br />
With fragrance and with beauty.&nbsp; Over us,<br />
A loving sun smiled from a cloudless sky,<br />
While a bold breeze kissed lightly as it passed,<br />
Clover in blossom, red and honey-sweet.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; On Nature seemed most beautiful of all&mdash;<br />
That evanescent beauty of the frost<br />
On window panes; of clean, fresh, fallen snow;<br />
Of white, white sunlight on the ice-draped trees.<br />
Winter, though rude, is delicate in art.</p>

And brings from that mysterious Land of Dreams<br />
A sense of beauty that illumines earth.<br />

<h4>SHE</h4>
<p class="poetry">I must begin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the young quarter of our
honeymoon.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You are but one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of countless men who take the
priceless boon<br />
Of woman&rsquo;s love and kill it at the start,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not wantonly but blindly.&nbsp;
Woman&rsquo;s passion<br />
Is such a subtle thing&mdash;woof of her heart,<br />
Web of her spirit; and the body&rsquo;s part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is to play ever but the lesser r&ocirc;le<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To her white soul.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seized in brute fashion,<br />
It fades like down on wings of butterflies;<br />
Then dies.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So my love died.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on base Mammon&rsquo;s cross you nailed my
pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Making me ask for what was mine by right:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until, in my own sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I seemed a helpless slave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom the master gave<br />
A grudging dole.&nbsp; Oh, yes, at times gifts showered<br />
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Upon your
chattel; but I was not dowered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By generous love.&nbsp; Hate never framed a curse<br
/>
Or placed a cruel ban<br />
That so crushed woman, as the law of man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes her pensioner upon his purse.<br />
That necessary stuff called gold is such<br />
A cold, rude thing it needs the nicest touch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thought and speech when it approaches love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or it will prove the certain death thereof.</p>

<p class="poetry">How large thy task, O teacher of the young,<br

To take the ravelled threads by parents flung<br />
With careless hands, and through consummate care<br />
To weave a fabric, fine and firm and fair.<br />
God&rsquo;s uncompleted work is thine to do&mdash;<br />

MAKING</h3>
<p class="poetry">Methinks there is no greater work in life<br />
Than making beauty.&nbsp; Can the mind conceive<br />
One little corner in celestial realms<br />
Unbeautiful, or dull or commonplace?<br />
Or picture ugly angels, illy clad?<br />
Beauty and splendour, opulence and joy,<br />
Are attributes of God and His domain,<br />
And so are worth and virtue.&nbsp; But why preach<br />
Of virtue only to the sons of men,<br />
Ignoring beauty, till they think it sin?<br />
Why, if each dweller on this little globe<br />
Could know the sacred meaning of that word<br />
And understand its deep significance,<br />
Men&rsquo;s thoughts would form in beauty, till their dreams<br
/>
Of heaven would find expression in their lives,<br />
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>However
humble; they themselves would grow<br />
Godlike, befitting such a fair estate.<br />
Let us be done with what is only good,<br />
Demanding here and now the beautiful;<br />
Lest, with the mind and eye on earth untrained,<br />
We shall be ill at ease when heaven is gained.</p>

AVON&rsquo;S BREAST I SAW A STATELY SWAN</h3>
<p class="poetry">One day when England&rsquo;s June was at its
best,<br />
I saw a stately and imperious swan<br />
Floating on Avon&rsquo;s fair untroubled breast.<br />
Sudden, it seemed as if all strife had gone<br />
Out of the world; all discord, all unrest.</p>
<p class="poetry">The sorrows and the sinnings of the race<br />
Faded away like nightmares in the dawn.<br />
All heaven was one blue background for the grace<br />
Of Avon&rsquo;s beautiful, slow-moving swan;<br />
And earth held nothing mean or commonplace.</p>
<p class="poetry">Life seemed no longer to be hurrying on<br />
With unbecoming haste; but softly trod,<br />
As one who reads in emerald leaf, or lawn,<br />
Or crimson rose a message straight from God.<br />
. . . . .<br />
On Avon&rsquo;s breast I saw a stately swan.</p>

LITTLE GO-CART</h3>
<p class="poetry">It was long, long ago that a soul like a
flower<br />
Unfolded, and blossomed, and passed in an hour.<br />
It was long, long ago; and the memory seems<br />
Like the pleasures and sorrows that come in our dreams.</p>
<p class="poetry">The kind years have crowned me with many a
joy<br />
Since the going away of my wee little boy;<br />
Each one as it passed me has stooped with a kiss,<br />
And left some delight&mdash;knowing one thing I miss.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when in the park or the street, all
elate<br />
A baby I see in his carriage of state,<br />
As proud as a king, in his little go-cart&mdash;<br />
I feel all the mother-love stir in my heart!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>And I seem to be back in that long-vanished May;<br />
And the baby, who came but to hurry away<br />
In the little white hearse, is not dead, but alive,<br />
And out in his little go-cart for a drive.</p>
<p class="poetry">I whisper a prayer as he rides down the
street,<br />
And my thoughts follow after him, tender and sweet;<br />
For I know, by a law that is vast and divine,<br />
(Though I know not his name) that the baby is mine!</p>

And I wish my feet were winged to speed on faster,<br />
And I wish I might behold you here to-day,<br />
Lord of men.</p>
<p class="poetry">I am running, yet I walk beside my
neighbour,<br />
And I take the duties given me to do;<br />
Yes, I take the daily duties as they fall<br />
(While I run, while I run),<br />

For I think this is the way that leads to you,<br />
Lord of all.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Oftentimes to just the art of being glad;<br />

(While I run, while I run).<br />
For the soul that worships God must worship beauty,<br />
And the heart that thinks of You can not be sad,<br />
Lord of light.</p>
<p class="poetry">I am running, yet I pause to greet my
brother,<br />
And I lean to rid my garden of its weed;<br />
Yes, I lean, although I lift my thoughts above<br />
(While I run, while I run).<br />
And I think of that command, &lsquo;Love one another,&rsquo;<br
/>
As I hear discordant sounds of creed with creed,<br />
Lord of Love.</p>
<p class="poetry">I am running, and the road is lit with
splendour,<br />
And it brightens and shines fairer with each span;<br />
Yes, it brightens like the highway in a dream<br />
(While I run, while I run).<br />
And my heart to all the world grows very tender,<br />
For I seem to see the Christ in every man,<br />
Lord supreme.</p>

And guillotines decide our least disputes.<br />

No vested power in this great day and land<br />
Can gag or throttle; Press and voice may cry<br />
Loud disapproval of existing ills,<br />
May criticise oppression and condemn<br />
The lawlessness of wealth-protecting laws<br />
That let the children and child-bearers toil<br />
To purchase ease for idle millionaires,<br />
Therefore do I protest against the boast<br />
Of independence in this mighty land.<br />

The precious one beneath her heart; until<br />

STATUE</h3>
<p class="poetry">A granite rock in the mountain side<br />
Gazed on the world and was satisfied.<br />
It watched the centuries come and go,<br />
It welcomed the sunlight yet loved the snow,<br />
It grieved when the forest was forced to fall,<br />
Yet joyed when steeples rose white and tall<br />
In the valley below it, and thrilled to hear<br />
The voice of the great town roaring near.</p>

Was caught by the mill-wheel and borne away<br />

Friend of the mountain and star and plain,<br />
Unchanged forever by God&rsquo;s decree<br />
While passing centuries bow to me.&rsquo;</p>

Wrenched, and ruined in peace and pride,<br />
&lsquo;Oh, God is cruel,&rsquo; the granite cried,<br />
&lsquo;Comrade of mountain, of star the friend,<br />
By all deserted&mdash;how sad my end.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">A dreaming sculptor in passing by<br />
Gazed on the granite with thoughtful eye;<br />
Then stirred with a purpose supremely grand<br />
He bade his dream in the rock expand.<br />

That grieved and doubted, it came to pass<br />
That a glorious statue of priceless worth<br />
And infinite beauty adorned the earth.</p>

<p class="poetry">Now you shall listen to a few plain facts<br />
Before you go out wholly from my life<br />
As some man&rsquo;s wife.<br />
Read carefully this statement of your acts<br />
Which changed the lustre of my honeymoon<br />
To sombre gloom,<br />
And wrenched the cover from Pandora&rsquo;s box.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>In those first talks<br />
&rsquo;Twixt bride and groom I showed you my whole heart,<br />
Showed you how deep my love was and how true;<br />
With all a strong man&rsquo;s feeling I loved YOU:<br />
(God, how I loved you, my one chosen mate.)<br />
But I learned this<br />
(So poorly did you play your little part):<br />
You married marriage, to avoid the fate<br />
Of having &lsquo;Miss&rsquo;<br />
Carved on your tombstone.&nbsp; Love you did not know,<br />
But you were greedy for the showy things<br />
That money brings.<br />
Such weak affection as you could bestow<br />
Was given the provider, not the lover.</p>
<p class="poetry">The knowledge hurt.&nbsp; Keen pain like that
is dumb;<br />
And masks itself in smiles, lest men discover.<br />
But I was lonely; and the feeling grew<br />
The more I studied you.<br />
Into your shallow heart love could not come,<br />
But yet you loved my love; because it gave<br />
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>The
prowess of a mistress o&rsquo;er a slave.<br />
You showed your power<br />
In petty tyranny hour after hour,<br />
Day after day, year after lengthening years.<br />
My tasks, my pleasures, my pursuits were not<br />
Held near or dear,<br />
Or made to seem important in your thought.<br />
My friends were not your friends; you goaded me<br />
By foolish and ignoble jealousy,<br />
Till, through suggestion&rsquo;s laws<br />
I gave you cause.<br />
The beauteous ideal Love had hung<br />
In my soul&rsquo;s shrine,<br />
And worshipped as a something all divine,<br />
With wanton hand you flung<br />
Into the dust.&nbsp; And then you wondered why<br />
My love should die.<br />
My sins and derelictions cry aloud<br />
To all the world: my head is bowed<br />
Under its merited reproaches.&nbsp; Yours<br />
Is lifted to receive<br />
The sympathy the court&rsquo;s decree insures.<br />
The world loves to believe<br />
In man&rsquo;s depravity and woman&rsquo;s worth;<br />
But I am one of many men on earth<br />
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Whose loud
resounding fall<br />
Is like the crashing of some well-built wall<br />

Be not afraid.<br />
The alimony will be promptly paid</p>

DIALOGUE</h3>
<h4>HE</h4>
<p class="poetry">Let us be friends.&nbsp; My life is sad and
lonely,<br />
While yours with love is beautiful and bright.<br />
Be kind to me: I ask your friendship only.<br />
No Star is robbed by lending darkness light.</p>
<h4>SHE</h4>
<p class="poetry">I give you friendship as I understand it,<br />
A sentiment I feel for all mankind.</p>
<h4>HE</h4>
<p class="poetry">Oh, give me more; may not one friend command
it?</p>
<h4>SHE</h4>
<p class="poetry">Look in the skies, &rsquo;tis there the star
you&rsquo;ll find;<br />
It casts its beams on all with equal favour.</p>
<h4>HE</h4>
<p class="poetry">I would have more than what all men may
claim.</p>
<h4><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>SHE</h4>
<p class="poetry">Then your ideas of friendship strongly
savour<br />
Of sentiments which wear another name.</p>
<h4>HE</h4>
<p class="poetry">May not one friend receive more than
another?</p>
<h4>SHE</h4>
<p class="poetry">Not man from woman and still remain a
friend.<br />
Life holds but three for her, a father, brother,<br />
Lover&mdash;against the rest she must contend.</p>
<h4>HE</h4>
<p class="poetry">Against the universe I would protect you,<br />
With my life even, nor hold the price too dear.</p>
<h4>SHE</h4>
<p class="poetry">But not against <i>yourself</i>, should fate
select you<br />
As Lancelot for foolish Guinevere.</p>
<h4>HE</h4>
<p class="poetry">You would not tempt me?</p>
<h4>SHE</h4>
<p class="poetry">That is undisputed.<br />
We put the question back upon the shelf.<br />
My point remains unanswered, unrefuted<br />
No man protects a woman from himself.</p>
<h4><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>HE</h4>
<p class="poetry">I am immune: for once I loved with passion,<br
/>
And all the fires within me burned to dust.<br />
I think of woman but in friendly fashion:<br />
In me she finds a comrade safe to trust.</p>
<h4>SHE</h4>
<p class="poetry">So said Mount Peel&eacute;e to the listening
ocean:<br />
Behold what followed!&nbsp; Let the good be wise.<br />
Though human hearts proclaim extinct emotion,<br />
Beware how high the tides of friendship rise.</p>
<h3><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>A
WISH</h3>
<p class="poetry">Great dignity ever attends great grief,<br />
And silently walks beside it;<br />
And I always know when I see such woe<br />
That Invisible Helpers guide it.<br />
And I know deep sorrow is like a tide,<br />
It cannot ever be flowing;<br />
The high-water mark in the night and the dark&mdash;<br />
Then dawn, and the outward going.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the people who pull at my heart-strings
hard<br />
Are the ones whom destiny hurries<br />
Through commonplace ways to the end of their days,<br />
And pesters with paltry worries.<br />
The peddlers who trudge with a budget of wares<br />
To the door that is slammed unkindly;<br />
The vendor who stands with his shop in his hands<br />
Where the hastening hosts pass blindly;</p>
<p class="poetry">The woman who holds in her poor flat purse<br
/>
The price of her rent-room only,<br />
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>While her
starved eye feeds on the comfort she needs<br />
To brighten the lot that is lonely;<br />
The man in the desert of endless work,<br />
Unsoftened by islands of leisure;<br />
And the children who toil in the dust and the soil,<br />
While their little hearts cry for pleasure;</p>
<p class="poetry">The people who labour, and scrimp, and save,<br
/>
At the call of some thankless duty,<br />
And carefully hide, with a mien of pride,<br />
Their ravening hunger for beauty;<br />
These ask no pity, and seek no aid,<br />
But the thought of them somehow is haunting;<br />
And I wish I might fling at their feet everything<br />
That I know in their hearts they are wanting.</p>
<h3><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>JUSTICE</h3>
<p class="poetry">However inexplicable may seem<br />
Event and circumstance upon the earth,<br />
Though favours fall on those who none esteem,<br />
And insult and indifference greet worth,<br />
Though poverty repays a life of toil,<br />
And riches spring where idle feet have trod,<br />
And storms lay waste the patiently tilled soil&mdash;<br />
Yet Justice sways the universe of God.</p>
<p class="poetry">As undisturbed the stately stars remain<br />
Beyond the glare of day&rsquo;s obscuring light,<br />
So Justice dwells, though mortal eyes in vain<br />
Seek it persistently by reason&rsquo;s sight.<br />
But, when once freed, the illumined soul looks out&mdash;<br />
Its cry will be, &lsquo;O God, how could I doubt?&rsquo;</p>

SONG</h3>
<p class="poetry"><i>Two roadways lead from this land to
That</i>, <i>and one is the road of Prayer</i>;<br />
<i>And one is the road of Old-time Songs</i>, <i>and every note
is a stair</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">A shabby old man with a music machine on the
sordid city street;<br />
But suddenly earth seemed Arcady, and life grew young and
sweet.<br />
For the city street fled, and the world was green, and a little
house stood by the sea;<br />
And she came singing a martial air (she who was peace itself);<br
/>
She brought back with her the old, strange charm, of mingled
pathos and glee&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>With her eyes of a child in a woman&rsquo;s face, and
her soul of a saint in an elf.<br />
She had been gone for many a year.&nbsp; They tell us it is not
far&mdash;<br />
That silent place where the dear ones go, but it might as well be
a star.<br />
Yes, it might as well be a distant star as a beautiful Near-by
Land,<br />
If we hear no voice, and see no face, and feel no touch of a
hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">But now she had come, for I saw her there, and
she looked so blithe and young;<br />
(Not white and still, as I saw her last) and the rose that she
wore was red;<br />
And her voice soared up in a bird-like trill, at the end of the
song she sung,<br />
And she mimicked a soldier&rsquo;s warlike stride, and tossed
back her dear little head.</p>
<p class="poetry">She had gone for many a year, and never came
back before;<br />
But I think she dwells in a Near-by Land, since song jarred open
the door;<br />
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Yes, I
think it is surely a Near-by Land, that place where our loved
ones are,<br />

So must it rave&mdash;this sick and suffering world&mdash;<br />
Until the old secretions in its blood<br />
Are emptied out and purged away by war;<br />
And the deep seated cankers of the mind<br />
Begin the healing process.&nbsp; Then a calm<br />

Let us decline to both question and doubt.<br />
If one goes cavilling,<br />
Hair splitting, flaw hunting&mdash;ready for strife&mdash;<br />
All the best pleasure is missed in the travelling<br />
Onward through life.</p>

Nor will we fear anything, or go borrowing<br />
Pain from the future by profitless dread.<br />

And life grows sadder, but love grows stronger,<br />
For those who walk with us day by day.</p>
<p class="poetry">The tear comes quicker, the laugh comes
slower;<br />
The courage is lesser to do and dare;<br />
And the tide of joy in the heart falls lower,<br />
And seldom covers the reefs of care.</p>
<p class="poetry">But all true things in the world seem truer;<br

And the better things of earth seem best;<br />
And friends are dearer, as friends are fewer,<br />
And love is all, as our sun dips west.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then let us clasp hands as we walk together,<br

And let us speak softly in love&rsquo;s sweet tone;<br />
For no man knows on the morrow whether<br />
We two pass on&mdash;or but one alone.</p>

<p class="poetry">Oh! that is a beautiful land I wis,<br />
The land of the Gone-Away Souls.<br />
Yes, a lovelier region by far than this<br />

The goodliest goal of all good goals,<br />
Else why do our friends stay there?<br />
I walk in a world that is sweet with friends,<br />
And earth I have ever held dear;<br />

To render the earth plane bright.<br />
But faster and faster, year on year<br />
My comrades hurry from sight.</p>

As if on a secret quest.<br />

In the din of the world below,<br />
Or hearing the message, can understand<br />
Those truths which we long to know.</p>

And I think of it more and more,<br />
Yes I think of that land of the Gone-Away-Souls<br />

Who will hail my bark when it touches shore<br />
Where the last brief journey ends.</p>

<p>[In Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s story, &lsquo;The Pit and the

to a huge, knife-edged pendulum which swings back and forth
across his body, the blade dropping closer to his heart at each
swing.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Bound hand and foot in the pit I lie,<br />
And the wall about me is strong and high;<br />
Stronger and higher it grows each day,<br />
With maximum labour and minimum pay;<br />
And there is no ladder whereon to climb<br />
To a fairer world and a brighter time.<br />
There is no ladder, there is no rope,<br />
But the devil of greed has given a hope.<br />
He swings before me the pendulum&mdash;Vice;<br />
I know its purpose and know its price,<br />
And the world&rsquo;s good people all know it, too,<br />
And much they chatter and little they do.<br />
I have sent up my cry to the hosts of men<br />
Over and over and over again:<br />
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>But
should I cry once to the devil, ah, he<br />
Would hurry to answer and set me free.<br />
For Virtue to Virtue must ever call thrice,<br />
But once brings an answer when Virtue calls Vice.</p>

But sudden shadow seemed to shroud my sun.<br />
He praised me: yet each slow, unwilling word<br />
Forced from its sheath base Envy&rsquo;s hidden sword,<br />
Two-edged, it wounded me; but, worst of all,<br />
It thrust my friend down from his pedestal,<br />
And showed him as he was&mdash;so small, so small.</p>

NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET</h3>
<p class="poetry">There was once a little comet who lived near
the Milky Way!<br />
She loved to wander out at night and jump about and play.<br />
The mother of the comet was a very good old star&mdash;<br />
She used to scold her reckless child for venturing out too
far;<br />
She told her of the ogre, Sun, who loved on stars to sup,<br />
And who asked no better pastimes than gobbling comets up.</p>
<p class="poetry">But instead of growing cautious and of showing
proper fear,<br />
The foolish little comet edged up near, and near, and near.<br />
She switched her saucy tail along right where the Sun could
see,<br />
<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>And
flirted with old Mars and was bold as bold could be.<br />
She laughed to scorn the quiet stars, who never frisked about;<br

She said there was no fun in life unless you ventured out.</p>
<p class="poetry">She liked to make the planets stare, and wished
no better mirth<br />
Than just to see the telescopes aimed at her from the Earth.<br
/>
She wondered how so many stars could mope through nights and
days,<br />
And let the sickly faced old moon get all the love and praise.<br
/>
And as she talked and tossed her head and switched her shining
trail,<br />
The staid old mother star grew sad, her cheek grew wan and
pale.</p>
<p class="poetry">For she had lived there in the skies a million
years or more,<br />
And she had heard gay comets talk in just this way before.<br />

<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>She went
a tiny bit too far&mdash;and vanished in the Sun!<br />
No more she swings her shining trail before the whole

But quiet stars she laughed to scorn are twinkling every
night.</p>

LAST DANCE</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">WHEN LOVE
FOR HIS MAKER AWOKE IN MAN, THE DANCE BEGAN</span></p>
<p class="poetry">The wave of the ocean, the leaf of the wood,<br
/>
In the rhythm of motion proclaim life is good.<br />
The stars are all swinging to metres and rhyme,<br />
The planets are singing while suns mark the time.<br />
The moonbeams and rivers float off in a trance,<br />
The Universe quivers&mdash;on, on with the dance!</p>
<p class="poetry">Our partners we pick from the best of the
throng<br />
In the ballroom of Life and go lilting along;<br />
We follow our fancy, and choose as we will,<br />
For waltz or for tango or merry quadrille;<br />
But ever one partner is waiting us all<br />
At the end of the programme, to finish the ball.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Unasked, and unwelcome, he comes without leave<br />
And calls when he chooses, &lsquo;My dance, I believe?&rsquo;<br
/>
And none may refuse him, and none may say no;<br />
When he beckons the dancer, the dancer must go.<br />
You may hate him, and shun him; and yet in life&rsquo;s ball<br
/>
For the one who lives well &rsquo;tis the best dance of all.</p>
<h3><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>A
VAGABOND MIND</h3>
<p class="poetry">Since early this morning the world has seemed
surging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With unworded rhythm, and rhyme without thought.<br
/>
It may be the Muses take this way of urging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The patience and pains by which poems are
wrought.<br />
It may be some singer who passed into glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With songs all unfinished, is lingering near<br />
And trying to tell me the rest of the story,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I am too dull of perception to hear.</p>
<p class="poetry">I hear not, I see not; but feel the sweet
swinging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And swaying of metre, in sunlight and shade,<br />
The still arch of Space with such music is ringing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As never an audible orchestra made.<br />
The moments glide by me, and each one is dancing;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aquiver with life is each leaf on the tree,<br />
And out on the ocean is movement entrancing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As billow with billow goes racing with glee.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>With never a thought that is worthy the saying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never a theme to be put into song,<br />
Since early this morning my mind has been straying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A vagabond thing, with a vagabond throng,<br />
With gay, idle moments, and waves of the ocean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With winds and with sunbeams, and tree-tops and
birds,<br />
It has lilted along in the joy of mere motion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To songs without music and verse without words.</p>
<h3><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>MY
FLOWER ROOM</h3>
<p class="poetry">My Flower Room is such a little place,<br />
Scarce twenty feet by nine; yet in that space<br />
I have met God; yea, many a radiant hour<br />
Have talked with Him, the All-Embracing-Cause,<br />
About His laws.<br />
And He has shown me, in each vine and flower<br />
Such miracles of power<br />
That day by day this Flower Room of mine<br />
Has come to be a shrine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fed by the self-same soil and atmosphere<br />
Pale, tender shoots appear<br />
Rising to greet the light in that sweet room.<br />
One speeds to crimson bloom;<br />
One slowly creeps to unassuming grace;<br />
One climbs, one trails;<br />
One drinks the light and moisture;<br />
One exhales.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Up through the earth together, stem by stem<br />
Two plants push swiftly in a floral race;<br />
Till one sends forth a blossom like a gem;<br />
And one gives only fragrance<br />
In a seed<br />
So small it scarce is felt within the hand.<br />
Lie hidden such delights<br />
Of scents and sights,<br />
When by the elements of Nature freed,<br />
As Paradise must have at its command.</p>
<p class="poetry">From shapeless roots and ugly bulbous things<br
/>
What gorgeous beauty springs!<br />
Such infinite variety appears<br />
A hundred artists in a hundred years<br />
Could never copy from the floral world<br />
The marvels that in leaf and bud lie curled.<br />
Nor could the most colossal mind of man<br />
Create one little seed of plant or vine<br />
Without assistance from the First Great Plan;<br />
Without the aid divine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Who but a God<br />
Could draw from light and moisture, heat and cold,<br />
And fashion in earth&rsquo;s mould,<br />
<a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>A
multitude of blooms to deck one sod?<br />
Who but a God!<br />
Not one man knows<br />
Just why the bloom and fragrance of the rose<br />
Or how its tints were blent;<br />
Or why the white Camelia without scent<br />
Up through the same soil grows;<br />
Or how the daisy and the violet<br />
And blades of grass first on wild meadows met.<br />
Not one, not one man knows;<br />
The wisest but SUPPOSE.</p>
<p class="poetry">This Flower Room of mine<br />
Has come to be a shrine;<br />
And I go hence<br />
Each day with larger faith and reverence.</p>
<h3><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>MY
FAITH</h3>
<p class="poetry">My faith is rooted in no written creed;<br />
And there are those who call me heretic;<br />
Yet year on year, though I be well or sick<br />
Or opulent, or in the slough of need,<br />
If, light of foot, fair Life trips by me pleasuring,<br />
Or, by the rule of pain, old Time stands measuring<br />
The dull, drab moments&mdash;still ascends my cry:<br />
&lsquo;God reigns on high!<br />
He doeth all things well!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Not much I prize, or one, or any brand<br />
Of theologic lore; nor think too well<br />
Of generally accepted heaven and hell.<br />
But faith and knowledge build at Love&rsquo;s command<br />
A beauteous heaven; a heaven of thought all clarified<br />
Of hate and fear and doubt; a heaven of rarefied<br />
And perfect trust; and from the heaven I cry:<br />
&lsquo;God reigns on high!<br />
Whatever is, is best.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>My faith refuses to accept the &lsquo;fall&rsquo;!<br
/>
It sees man ever as a child of God,<br />
Growing in wisdom as new realms are trod,<br />
Until the Christ in him is One with All.<br />
From this full consciousness my faith is borrowing<br />
Light to illuminate Life&rsquo;s darkest sorrowing,<br />
Whatever woes assail me still I cry:<br />
&lsquo;God reigns on high!<br />
He doeth all things well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">My faith finds prayer the language of the
heart,<br />
Which gives us converse with the host unseen;<br />
And those who linger in the vales between<br />
The Here and Yonder, in these prayers take part.<br />
My dead come near, and say: &lsquo;Death means not perishing;<br
/>
Cherish us in your thoughts, for by that cherishing<br />
Shall severed links be welded by and by.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;God reigns on high!<br />
Whatever is, is best.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>ARROW AND BOW</h3>
<p class="poetry">It is easy to stand in the pulpit, or in the
closet to kneel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And say: &lsquo;God do this; God do that!&mdash;<br
/>
Make the world better; relieve the sorrows of man; for the sake
of Thy Son,<br />
Oh, forgive all sin!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, having planned out
God&rsquo;s work, to feel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our duty is done.<br />
It is easy to be religious this way&mdash;<br />
Easy to pray.</p>
<p class="poetry">It is harder to stand on the highway, or walk
in the crowded mart;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And say: &lsquo;I am He.&nbsp; I am He.<br />
&lsquo;Mine the world-burden; mine the sorrows of men; mine the
Christ-work<br />
&lsquo;To forgive my brother&rsquo;s sin,&rsquo; and then to live
the Christ-part and never to shirk.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>It is hard for you and me<br />
To be religious this way,<br />
Day after day.</p>
<p class="poetry">But God is no longer in heaven; we drove Him
out with our prayers,<br />
Drove Him out with our sermons and creeds, and our endless
plaints and despairs.<br />
He came down over the borders, and Christ, too, came along;<br />
They are looking the whole world over to see just what is
wrong.<br />
God has grown weary of hearing His praises sung on earth;<br />
And Jesus is weary of hearing the story about His birth;<br />
And the way to win Their favour, that is surer than any other,<br
/>
Is to join in a song of Brotherhood and praises of one
another.</p>
<p class="poetry">No; God is no longer in heaven; He has come
down on earth to see<br />
That nothing is wrong with the world He made; <i>the wrong is in
you and me</i>.<br />
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>He meant
the earth for a garden-spot, where mill and factory stand;<br />
Childhood, he meant for growing-time&mdash;but look at the
toiling band!<br />
Woman was meant for mother and mate&mdash;now look at the slaves
of lust.<br />
And the good folks shake their heads and say, &lsquo;We must pray
to God and trust.&rsquo;<br />
God has a billion books of our prayers unopened upon his
shelves,<br />
For the things we are begging Him to do, He wants us to do
ourselves.</p>
<p class="poetry">Jehovah, Jesus, and each soul in space<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are one and undividable.&nbsp; Until<br />
We see God shining in each neighbour&rsquo;s face<br />
And find Him in ourselves and hail Him there,<br />
What use is prayer?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us be still.<br />
How can we love the whole and not each part?<br />
How worship God, and harbour in the heart<br />
Hate of God&rsquo;s members&mdash;for all men are that.<br />
Too long our souls have sat,<br />
Like poor blind beggars at the door of God.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He never made a beggar&mdash;we are kings!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>Let us rise up, for it is time we trod<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountain-tops; time that we did the things<br />
We have so long asked God to do.<br />
He waits for you<br />
To look deep in your brother&rsquo;s eyes and see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The God within;<br />
To hear you say &lsquo;Lo, thou art He; Lo, thou art
He.&rsquo;<br />
This is the only way to end all sin,<br />
The difficult, one way.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>A prayer without a deed is an arrow without
a bow-string</i>;<br />
<i>A deed without a prayer is a bow-string without an
arrow</i>.<br />
<i>The heart of a man should be like a quiver full of
arrows</i>,<br />
<i>And the hand of a man should be like a strong bow strung for
action</i>.<br />
<i>The heart of a man should keep his arrows ever
ascending</i>,<br />
<i>And the hand and the mind of a man should keep at a work
unending</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>IF
WE SHOULD MEET HIM</h3>
<p class="poetry">Now what were the words of Jesus,<br />
And what would He pause and say,<br />
If we were to meet in home or street<br />
The Lord of the world to-day?<br />
Oh, I think He would pause and say,<br />
&lsquo;Go on with your chosen labour;<br />
Speak only good of your neighbour;<br />
Widen your farms, and lay down your arms,<br />
Or dig up the soil with each sabre.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Now what were the answer of Jesus<br />
If we should ask for a creed<br />
To carry us straight through the wonderful gate<br />
When soul from body is freed?<br />
Oh, I think He would give us this creed:<br />
&lsquo;Praise God, whatever betide you;<br />
Cast joy on the lives beside you;<br />
Better the earth, by growing in worth,<br />
With love as the law to guide you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Now what were the answer of Jesus<br />
If we should ask Him to tell<br />
Of the last great goal of the homing soul,<br />
Where each of us hopes to dwell.<br />
Oh, I think it is this He would tell:<br />
&lsquo;The soul is the builder&mdash;then wake it;<br />
The mind is the kingdom&mdash;then take it;<br />
And thought upon thought let Eden be wrought,<br />
For heaven will be what you make it.&rsquo;</p>

125</span>FAITH</h3>
<p class="poetry">Let a valiant Faith cross swords with Death,<br
/>
And Death is certain to fall;<br />
For the dead arise with joy in their eyes&mdash;<br />
They were not dead at all.<br />
If this were only a world of chance,<br />
Then faith, with its strong white spark<br />
Could burn through the sod and fashion a God,<br />
And set Him to shine in the dark.</p>
<p class="poetry">So in troublesome days, and in shadowy ways,<br
/>
In the dire and difficult time,<br />
We must cling, we must cling to our Faith, and bring<br />
Our courage to heights sublime.<br />
It is not a matter of hugging a creed<br />
That will lift us up to the light,<br />
But in keeping our trust that Love is just,<br />
And that whatever is, is right.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>When the hopes of this world into chaos are hurled,<br
/>
And the devil seems running the earth,<br />
When the bad folks stay and the good pass away,<br />
And greed fares better than worth,<br />
Oh, that is the hour to trust in the Power<br />
That will straighten the tangle out;<br />
For death and sorrow are little things,<br />
But a terrible thing is doubt.</p>
<h3><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>THE
SECRET OF PRAYER</h3>
<blockquote><p>For he who climbs to say his prayer<br />
Meets half way the descending Grace.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Elsa
Barker</span>, in <i>British Review</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">This is the secret of all prayers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in God&rsquo;s sight have worth,<br />
They must be uttered from the stairs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That wind away from earth;<br />
And he who mounts to speak the word,<br />
He shall be heard.&nbsp; He shall be heard.</p>
<p class="poetry">And he who will not leave himself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But stays down with his cares,<br />
Or with his thoughts of pride and pelf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though loud and long his prayers,<br />
Beyond earth&rsquo;s dome of arching skies<br />
They shall not rise.&nbsp; They shall not rise.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, ye who seek for strength and power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek first some quiet spot,<br />
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>And
fashion through a silent hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your stairway, thought by thought;<br />
Then climb, and pray to God on high:<br />
He shall reply.&nbsp; He shall reply.</p>
<h3><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>THE
ANSWER</h3>
<p class="poetry">Up to the gates of gleaming Pearl,<br />
There came the spirit of a girl,<br />
And to the white-robed Guard she said:<br />
&lsquo;Dear Angel, am I truly dead?<br />
Just yonder, lying on my bed,<br />
I heard them say it; and they wept.<br />
And after that, methinks I slept.<br />
Then when I woke, I saw your face,<br />
And suddenly was in this place.<br />
It seems a pleasant place to be,<br />
Yet earth was fair enough to me.<br />
What is there here, to do, or see?<br />
Will I see God, dear Angel, say?<br />
And is He very far away?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Angel said, &lsquo;You are in truth<br />
What men call dead.&nbsp; That word to youth<br />
Is full of terror; but it means<br />
Only a change of tasks, and scenes.<br />
<a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>You have
been brought to us because<br />
Of certain ancient karmic laws<br />
Set into motion &aelig;ons gone.<br />
By us you will be guided on<br />
From plane to plane, and sphere to sphere,<br />
Until your tasks are finished here.<br />
Then back to earth, the home of man,<br />
To work again another span.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But, Angel, when will I see
God?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;After the final path is trod;<br />
After you no more long, or crave,<br />
To see, or hear, or own, or have<br />
Aught beside&mdash;HIM.&nbsp; Then shall His face<br />
Reveal itself to you in space.<br />
And you shall find yourself made one<br />
With that Great Sun, behind the sun.<br />
Child, go thy way inside the gate,<br />
Where many eager loved ones wait.<br />
Death is but larger life begun.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>A
VISION</h3>
<p class="poetry">My soul beheld a vision of the Master:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Methought He stood with grieved and questioning
eyes,<br />
Where Freedom drove its chariot to disaster<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And toilers heard, unheeding, toilers&rsquo;
cries.<br />
Where man withheld God&rsquo;s bounties from his neighbour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fertile fields were sterilised by greed;<br />
Where Labour&rsquo;s hand was lifted against labour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And suffering serfs to despots turned when
freed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Majestic rose tall steeple after steeple;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Imperious bells called worshippers to prayer;<br />
But as they passed, the faces of the people<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were marred by envy, anger and despair.<br />
&lsquo;Christ the Redeemer of the world has risen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace and good will,&rsquo; so rang the major
strain;<br />
But forth from sweat-shops, tenement and prison<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wailed minor protests, redolent with pain.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Methought about the Master, all unseeing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fought desperate hosts of striking clan with
clan,<br />
Their primal purpose, meant for labour&rsquo;s freeing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunk in vindictive hate of man for man.<br />
Pretentious Wealth, in unearned robes of beauty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flung Want a pittance from her bulging purse,<br />
While ill-paid Toil went on dull rounds of duty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell in her heart, and on her lips a curse.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then spoke the Christ (so wondrous was my
vision)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Deep, deep, His voice, with sorrow&rsquo;s cadence
fraught):<br />
&lsquo;This world to-day would be a realm elysian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had my disciples lived the love I taught.<br />
Un-Christlike is the Christian creed men fashion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who kneel to worship, and who rise to slay.<br />
Profane pretenders of my holy Passion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye nail Me newly to the cross each day.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>THE
SECOND COMING</h3>
<p class="poetry">How will Christ come back again,<br />
How will He be seen, and where,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where His chosen way?<br />
Will He come in dead of night,<br />
Shining in His robes of light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or at dawn of day?</p>
<p class="poetry">Will it be at Christmas time,<br />
When the bells are all achime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That He is re-born?<br />
Or will He return and bring<br />
Wide and wondrous wakening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On some Easter morn?</p>
<p class="poetry">When will this sad world rejoice,<br />
Listening to that golden voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking unto men?<br />
Lives there one who yet shall cry<br />
Loud to startled passers-by&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Christ has come again?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Seek and you shall find him near&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwelling on the earth.<br />
By the world&rsquo;s awakened thought,<br />
This great miracle is wrought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This the second birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">While you wonder where and now<br />
Christ shall come&mdash;behold him <i>now</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Patient, loving, meek.<br />
Looking from your neighbour&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
Or in humble toiling guise&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo! the Christ you seek.</p>
<p class="poetry">Look for him in human hearts,<br />
In the shops, and in the marts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And beside your hearth.<br />
Search and speak the watchword Love,<br />
And the Christ shall rise and prove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He has come to earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sorrowful ofttimes is He<br />
That we have not eyes to see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have not ears to hear,<br />
As we call to Him afar,<br />
<a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Out
beyond some distant star,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While He stands so near.</p>
<p class="poetry">Seek Him, seek Him, where He dwells,<br />

Christ has come to earth again,<br />
He is in the hearts of men,<br />

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
